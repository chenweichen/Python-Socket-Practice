CV-TMLE and double machine learning
https://vanderlaan-lab.org/2019/12/24/cv-tmle-and-double-machine-learning/

Thanks for this interesting question. In the past several years, 
the interest in these machine learning-based estimators has become more widespread, 
since they allow for the statistical answer to a question to be framed 
in terms of scientifically meaningful parameters (e.g., defined through causal inference), 
incorporating machine learning in the estimation process, 
while providing formal statistical inference.

Targeted Maximum Likelihood for ATE, why not just GLM for ATE?
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/550318/targeted-maximum-likelihood-for-ate-why-not-just-glm-for-ate

The answer is double robustness. 
Like all doubly-robust methods, with TMLE you get two chances to get the model correct 
and the treatment effect estimate is consistent if either is correct (or approach at a given rate). 
With g-computation using a GLM, you only get one chance to get the model right. 
If that model is wrong (and it almost certainly is), then your treatment effect estimate is not consistent. 
You can use flexible machine learning methods with TMLE that are more likely to approximate the true form of either the treatment and outcome model. 
Indeed, given the inability of an outcome model GLM to even plausibly capture the true outcome model, 
one should almost never use it to estimate treatment effect, 
whereas TMLE should be among your first choices.

Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) is a semiparametric estimation 
framework to estimate a statistical quantity of interest. 
TMLE allows the use of machine learning (ML) models which place 
minimal assumptions on the distribution of the data. 
Unlike estimates normally obtained from ML, 
the final TMLE estimate will still have valid standard errors for 
statistical inference.

Targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) (sometimes targeted maximum likelihood estimation) is 
a general framework for constructing regular, asymptotically linear estimators for pathwise differentiable parameters 
with additional properties such as asymptotic efficiency and double robustness. 
For background and details, see Targeted Learning by van der Laan and Rose, or articles on TMLE.

Machine learning in the estimation of causal effects: targeted minimum loss-based estimation and double/debiased machine learning
https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/21/2/353/5631845?login=false

Biostatistics, Volume 21, Issue 2, April 2020, Pages 353‚Äì358, https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxz042

A limitation of the original TMLE formulation is that it imposed an assumption on the statistical model for the nuisance parameters. 
The ‚Äúuniform‚Äù central limit theorem necessary to derive the asymptotic distribution for the TMLE 
requires that the nuisance functions are elements of Donsker classes, which are classes of functions with limited entropy. 
This assumption is problematic in the context of machine learning because 
it is not satisfied by many estimation methods, e.g., those which yield functions with unbounded variation. 
The solution to this problem, named cross-validated TMLE (Zheng and van der Laan, 2011), uses sample-splitting to obtain out-of-sample estimates 
of the nuisance parameters, an idea that dates back to at least (Bickel, 1982). 
Because the nuisance estimates are constructed using out-of-sample data, asymptotic arguments 
for the validation sample can be made conditional on the training sample, and then averaged across validation samples, thus avoiding the Donsker condition.
