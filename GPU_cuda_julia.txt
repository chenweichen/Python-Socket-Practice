CUDA programming in Julia.
https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl

CUDA.jl currently also requires a CUDA-capable GPU with compute capability 3.5 (Kepler) or higher, 
and an accompanying NVIDIA driver with support for CUDA 10.1 or newer. 
These requirements are not enforced by the Julia package manager when installing CUDA.jl. 
Depending on your system and GPU, you may need to install an older version of the package.

Overview
https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/installation/overview/

The Julia CUDA stack requires users to have a functional NVIDIA driver and corresponding CUDA toolkit. 
The former should be installed by you or your system administrator, 
while the latter can be automatically downloaded by Julia using the artifact subsystem.


Platform-support

The main development platform (and the only CI system) however is x86_64 on Linux, 
so if you are using a more exotic combination there might be bugs.
