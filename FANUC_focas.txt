RoboDK API
https://robodk.com/doc/en/RoboDK-API.html#RoboDKAPI

The RoboDK API (Application Program Interface) is a set of routines and commands that RoboDK exposes through a programming language. The RoboDK API allows you to program any robot using one of the supported programming languages, such as C#, Python or C++. You can also automate repetitive tasks using the RoboDK API.

Compared to vendor-specific robot programming, with the RoboDK API it is possible to simulate and program any robot using a unique/universal programming language, such as Python. The following page provides an overview and a video showing offline programming with the API.

The RoboDK API is available for Python, C#, C, C++, Visual Basic (.NET) and Matlab. Any of these programming languages can be used to simulate and program any robot arm.
