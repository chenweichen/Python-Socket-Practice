Is it helpful to teach about metric spaces in a first real analysis course?
https://www.quora.com/Is-it-helpful-to-teach-about-metric-spaces-in-a-first-real-analysis-course

Not really.

Metric spaces is more of a specific set up for things like measure theory, and acts, in my opinion at least, as a framework for defining points and distances in sets, as well as the sets themselves.

All results from Real Analysis can be formulated from the perspective of metric spaces, but to do so in a first course would introduce a student to too much unnecessary machinery at once, disguising the motivation behind analysis.

The definitions in real analysis would barely change. In fact, they would be abstracted away from the reals into any set on which there exists a metric. To some of the uninitiated this sounds like a dream; learn a general method for analysis in any measurable set. But as someone who has taken both courses I can safely say you need to learn to walk before you can run.

Once the framework of metric spaces is introduced AFTER all the real analysis, it is much more straightforward for a student to take it all in and generalise to measurable sets- primarily because it's effectively a second pass of all the information from real analysis, just abstracting those basic notions to any measurable set you like.

Download the volume I of the book as PDF

(Version 5.6, May 16th, 2022, 282 pages, 1.8 MB download)

Download the volume II of the book as PDF

Check for any errata (volume I) (volume II) in the current version.
https://www.jirka.org/ra/errata.html

https://www.jirka.org/ra/errata2.html

Look at the change log (volume I) (volume II) to see what changed in the newest version.

https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

I started numbering things with version numbers starting at 4.0 for volume I, and version 1.0 for volume II. The first number is the major number and it really means "edition" and will be raised when substantial changes are made. The second number is raised for corrections only.
