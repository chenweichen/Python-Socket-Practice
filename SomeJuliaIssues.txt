This is what happens when academics develop programming languages

I prefer Yulias to Julias.

# Installing and using Julia
cd $HOME
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.7/julia-1.7.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xf julia-1.7.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
rm julia-1.7.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
export PATH=$HOME/julia-1.7.2/bin:$PATH


# Running Julia in interactive mode
To run Julia interactively on a login node, enter juliaand this will start a new Julia REPL session.

Note: Using Julia on a login node should be reserved for installing packages. 
A common mistake for new users of HPC clusters is to run heavy workloads directly on a login node 
(e.g., discovery.usc.eduor endeavour.usc.edu). 
Unless you are only running a small test, please make sure to run your program as a job interactively on a compute node. 
Processes left running on login nodes may be terminated without warning. 
For more information on jobs, see our Running Jobs user guide.

Using Julia interactively on a compute node is useful for more intensive work like exploring data, testing models, and debugg


# Running Julia in batch mode
To run Julia in batch mode, there are a few steps to follow:
1. Create a Julia script
2. Create a Slurm job script that runs the Julia script
3. Submit the job script using Slurm's sbatchcommand


# Installing Julia packages


# Parallel programming with Julia
Package	                Purpose
Base.Threads	        For explicit multi-threading
Distributed	            For explicit multi-processing
MPI.jl	                For interfacing to MPI libraries
DistributedArrays.jl	For working with distributed arrays
Elemental.jl	        For distributed linear algebra
ClusterManagers.jl	    For launching jobs via cluster job schedulers (e.g., Slurm)
Dagger.jl	            For asynchronous evaluations and workflows
CUDA.jl	                For interfacing to Nvidia CUDA GPUs
